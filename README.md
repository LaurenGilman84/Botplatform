# The Bot Platform API Documentation

## Getting started

To use this, you need a [The Bot Platform](http://thebotplatform.com) account and make sure your Account Manager has granted you API permissions.

The way our API works is simply passing the data from Messenger over to your server for response.

You need to make sure you add your url into the API url settings via your admin area.

Now any request that comes through from Work Chat or Messenger will now get sent onto your URL.

Along with the data from Facebook we also attach the user profile, and on top of that we also add on any information stored in The Bot Platform brain about that user.

From there you can respond to the request to send a message back to the user, by simply using the same response as the [Messenger Send API structure](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-api-reference#request).

## Examples in action

- [Node JS Hello World](examples/node/helloworld/routes/index.js)
- [PHP Hello World](examples/php/helloworld/index.php)

To view other examples, please make sure you check out the [Messenger docs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-api-reference#request)

## NLP

By default, Messenger's built-in NLP detects the following entities in English only:

- Greetings (English only)
- Thanks (English only)
- Bye (English only)
- Date/Time
- Amount of money
- Phone number
- Email address
- Date and time are automatically localized based on the locale sent in the user's profile.

For example, if someone sends the message, “tomorrow at 2pm” or “2 days before Xmas,” you will get the actual timestamp with the message.
